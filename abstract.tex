\section{INTRODUCTION}
%
We have developed a balance assisting bicycle that uses a custom electric motor
to apply a steering torque in parallel with the rider's steering actions. The
motor is controlled by a simple control algorithm based on feedback from a rate
gyroscope that measures roll angular rate. Applying a steering torque
proportional to the rolling rate in the same direction can lower the speed
range at which the bicycle feels self-stable to the rider. We hypothesize that
making the bicycle stable at lower speeds will reduce the control action needed
from the rider in basic balancing tasks and that use of such a system may
reduce falls. We have developed three comprehensive experiments to assess the
effectiveness of the balance assist effects. In the first experiments we both
distract the rider and apply small disturbances via the steering motor during
straight line balancing. In the second experiment, we apply increasingly large
perturbations to the handlebars via computer controlled ropes while riding on a
treadmill at low speeds. In the final experiment, we perturb straight line
riding via a kickplate, which slides the ground out under the front wheel of
the bicycle to see differences in recovery response with and without balance
assist.

\section{METHODS}
%
To design the controller, we utilized the linear Carvallo-Whipple bicycle model.
The states are the roll angle \(\phi\) and steer angle \(\delta\) along with
their derivatives and the inputs are roll torque \(T_\phi\) and steer torque
\(T_\delta\). The state \(\mathbf{A}\) and input \(\mathbf{B} =
\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{B}_\phi \quad \mathbf{B}_\delta\end{bmatrix} \)
matrices are functions of the equilibrium forward speed \(v\). The applied
steering torque \(T_\delta\) is the sum of the (h)uman and (m)otor torques,
with the motor torque following a proportional roll rate feedback law scheduled
by speed:
%
\begin{align}
  T_\delta =
  T_\delta^\textrm{h} + T_\delta^\textrm{m} =
  T_\delta^\textrm{h} - k_{\dot{\phi}}(v - v_\textrm{weave})\dot{\phi}
\end{align}
where \(v_\textrm{weave}\) is the bicycle's open loop weave critical speed.
This gives the closed loop model with the automatic control:
%
\begin{align}
  \dot{\vec{x}} =
  \left(
    \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}_\delta
    \left[0 \quad k_{\dot{\phi}}(v - v_\textrm{weave}) \quad 0 \quad 0\right]
  \right)
  \begin{bmatrix} \phi \\ \dot{\phi} \\ \delta \\ \dot{\delta} \end{bmatrix} +
  \mathbf{B}
  \begin{bmatrix} T_{\phi} \\ T_\delta^\textrm{h} \end{bmatrix}
  \label{eq:state-space}
\end{align}

The gain \(k_{\dot{\phi}}\) can be selected such that the eigenvalues of
Equation~\ref{eq:state-space} have negative real parts for a range of speeds.

We developed a series of three experiments to assess whether stabilizing the
bicycle is beneficial in safety critical scenarios:
\begin{description}
  \item[Experiment 1] Comparison of 18 older and 14 younger adults in straight
    line riding when 1) asked to look over their shoulder and 2) subjected
    handlebar motor perturbations with the balance assist system on and off. We
    measured the standard deviation of their steer and roll motions after the
    disturbances.
  \item[Experiment 2] Twenty-six young adults were subjected to externally
    applied and measured handlebar torques of varying magnitudes while riding
    on a treadmill at low speeds 6~\si{\kph} and 10~\si{\kph} to determine the
    magnitude of perturbation required to cause them to fall with the balance
    assist system on and off. We log the order of perturbations and their
    impulse as well as the bicycle state at the time of perturbation.
  \item[Experiment 3] We subject 11 participants riding at 12~\si{\kph} to
    lateral pulsive perturbations at the front tire contact patch as they rode
    over a kickplate. We measured the standard deviation of their steer and
    roll motions after the disturbances.
\end{description}

    \label{fig:fig1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We apply multivariate linear regression to the performance metrics derived from
each experiment (ANOVA in Experiments 1 \& 3, logistic in Experiment 2) and
investigate whether the balance assist system reduce response motions
(Experiments 1 \& 3) or if the probability of falling is reduced (Experiment
2).

\section{Results}
%
In Experiment 1, we found that the standard deviation of the roll rate during
straight riding is reduced when the balance assist system is turned on for both
young and old participants while the rider is disturbed. In Experiment 2, the
probability of falling is significantly reduced when the balance assist system
is on while riding at 6~\si{\kph}. There is a reduction in probability at
10~\si{\kph} also, but the effect was not statistically significant
(\(P=0.7\)). In Experiment 3, we found that the standard deviation of steer
angle, roll angle, and yaw angle are all significantly reduced post
perturbation when the balance assist system is on.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
%
The balance assist system, consisting of roll rate feedback steering control,
stabilizes the riderless bicycle at speeds greater than approximately
4~\si{\kph}, which is quite lower than the uncontrolled stable speeds of
greater than 18~\si{\kph}. The bicycle is rideable and we show that motions
resulting from disturbances are reduced with the system is on. We also show
that the probability of falling is significantly reduced at low speeds when the
system is on. Given that large steer and roll motions correlate to reduced
rider control authority and that many single actor falls occur at low speeds,
we project that wide use of a balance assisted bicycle may reduce falls and
thus injuries.
